## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Philosophical Alignment

All contributions should serve the core themes:
- **Collapse of Order**: Does your contribution explore the breakdown of systems?
- **Affirmation of Existence**: Does it emphasize authentic, immediate experience?

Ask yourself:
- How does this contribution serve the philosophical vision?
- Does it enable player agency and meaningful choice?
- Does it resist easy answers and embrace ambiguity?
- Could it create emergent, unplanned experiences?

### 2. Quality Standards

- **Functional**: Code should work as intended
- **Maintainable**: Others should be able to understand and modify it
- **Performant**: Consider impact on frame rate and memory
- **Thematic**: Implementation should reflect philosophical goals

### 3. Code Style

Follow existing code conventions:
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment technical complexity
- Explain philosophical intent
- Document emergent potential

Example:
```cpp
// Degrades UI reliability as world state collapses
// Philosophical intent: External structures become untrustworthy
// Emergent potential: Players may interpret degradation as bugs,
// then realize it's intentional, creating meta-commentary on trust
void DegradeUIReliability(float CollapseLevel)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### 4. Asset Standards

- **Naming**: Use consistent, descriptive names
- **Organization**: Follow project folder structure
- **Optimization**: Balance quality with performance
- **Attribution**: Credit sources for licensed assets
- **Philosophical Context**: Add metadata explaining thematic purpose

## Contribution Process

### Step 1: Discuss

For significant contributions:
1. Open a GitHub Issue describing your idea
2. Explain how it aligns with philosophical themes
3. Discuss implementation approach
4. Get feedback from maintainers

### Step 2: Develop

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes following guidelines
4. Test thoroughly (technical and experiential)
5. Document your changes

### Step 3: Submit

1. Commit with descriptive messages:
   ```
   [Category] Brief description
   
   Detailed explanation of changes.
   
   Philosophical alignment: How this serves the theme.
   ```

2. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

3. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear title
   - Detailed description
   - Screenshots/videos if relevant
   - Explanation of philosophical alignment
   - Testing performed

### Step 4: Review

- Maintainers will review your contribution
- Be open to feedback and discussion
- Make requested changes
- Once approved, your contribution will be merged

## What We Look For

### Excellent Contributions

- Align clearly with philosophical themes
- Enable emergent gameplay possibilities
- Are well-documented and maintainable
- Consider player interpretation and meaning-making
- Embrace ambiguity and complexity
- Show creative problem-solving

### Contributions We May Not Accept

- Contradict core philosophical themes
- Add rigid, inflexible systems
- Remove player agency
- Provide definitive answers to philosophical questions
- Prioritize conventional game design over thematic goals
- Are poorly documented or difficult to maintain

## Specific Contribution Areas

### Implementing System Degradation

When creating systems that degrade:
- Start with full functionality
- Create meaningful degradation stages
- Avoid frustration; maintain playability
- Let players adapt and discover alternatives
- Consider graceful rather than catastrophic failure

### Creating Philosophical Content

For NPCs, dialogue, or environmental narrative:
- Present multiple perspectives
- Ask questions rather than give answers
- Respect player interpretation
- Avoid heavy-handed exposition
- Trust the player's intelligence

### Building Emergent Systems

When designing systems:
- Allow for unplanned interactions
- Avoid over-constraining outcomes
- Create simple rules with complex possibilities
- Observe and document emergent behaviors
- Resist the urge to "fix" interesting emergence

### Designing Levels

For environment creation:
- Support multiple traversal approaches
- Reward exploration and attention
- Tell stories through environmental details
- Allow spaces to transform and degrade
- Create memorable, meaningful landmarks

## Community Guidelines

### Be Respectful

- Respect different perspectives
- Provide constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions
- Be patient with learning processes

### Be Collaborative

- Share knowledge and resources
- Help others understand philosophical themes
- Celebrate creative contributions
- Support experimentation

### Be Philosophical

- Engage thoughtfully with themes
- Question assumptions (including your own)
- Embrace productive disagreement
- Find meaning in the process, not just outcomes

## Getting Help

### Resources

- **PHILOSOPHY.md**: Core philosophical concepts
- **GAME_DESIGN.md**: Gameplay design principles
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Technical development guide

## Final Thoughts

Contributing to Six-Days is not just about adding code or content—it's about participating in a philosophical exploration through interactive media. Your contributions help create an experience that challenges conventional thinking about games, meaning, and existence.

We encourage you to:
- Experiment boldly
- Question assumptions
- Embrace emergence
- Find meaning in creation
- Affirm your existence through contribution

Thank you for being part of this journey.
