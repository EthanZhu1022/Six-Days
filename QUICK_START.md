# Quick Start Guide: Six-Days

## What is Six-Days?

Six-Days is a philosophical exploration game built in Unreal Engine 5.5 that explores two fundamental themes through interactive gameplay:

1. **The Collapse of Order** - Experiencing how rigid systems and structures break down
2. **The Affirmation of Existence** - Finding meaning through direct, authentic experience

## 5-Minute Overview

### The Core Concept

Imagine a game where:
- The UI and navigation systems progressively become unreliable
- Your character's identity emerges from your actions, not preset classes
- Choices matter but aren't judged as "good" or "evil"
- The game world operates in six distinct day-cycles, each exploring different aspects of collapse and affirmation
- Chaos and emergence are celebrated, not fixed as bugs

### The Experience

Players begin in a familiar game world with standard systems (mini-map, objectives, etc.). Over the course of six in-game days, these systems progressively fail, forcing players to develop new ways of navigating and finding meaning. The journey is about discovering that authentic existence doesn't require external structures.

## Where to Start

### If you want to understand the philosophy:
→ Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for deep philosophical exploration

### If you want to understand the gameplay:
→ Read [GAME_DESIGN.md](GAME_DESIGN.md) for how themes become mechanics

### If you want implementation details:
→ Read [GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS.md](GAMEPLAY_MECHANICS.md) for specific systems

### If you want to develop:
→ Read [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for technical setup

### If you want to contribute:
→ Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines

## Key Design Principles

1. **Philosophy First**: Every design decision serves the philosophical themes
2. **Experience Over Explanation**: Players understand through doing, not reading
3. **Emergence Welcome**: Unplanned behaviors are features, not bugs
4. **Ambiguity Embraced**: Multiple interpretations are valid
5. **Player Agency**: No single "correct" way to play

## The Six-Day Structure

| Day | Order Level | Theme | Player Experience |
|-----|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Day 1 | High (90-100%) | Order Established | Learning familiar systems |
| Day 2 | Good (75-85%) | First Doubts | Noticing inconsistencies |
| Day 3 | Medium (50-70%) | Growing Instability | Adapting to unreliability |
| Day 4 | Low (20-45%) | Collapse | Letting go of structure |
| Day 5 | Very Low (10-30%) | Discovery | Finding new navigation |
| Day 6 | Minimal (0-15%) | Affirmation | Pure experiential existence |

## What Makes This Different?

### Traditional Games
- Fixed rules and systems
- Clear objectives and progression
- UI remains consistent
- Character classes define abilities
- Good vs. evil choices

### Six-Days
- Systems progressively fail
- Objectives become ambiguous
- UI degrades and disappears
- Identity emerges from actions
- Choices without moral judgment

## Philosophical Influences

- **Nietzsche**: Critique of absolute values, eternal return, amor fati
- **Heidegger**: Dasein (being-there), authentic existence
- **Sartre**: Radical freedom, existence precedes essence
- **Camus**: Absurdism, finding meaning despite meaninglessness

## Technical Foundation

- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.5
- **Key Features**: Nanite (detail), Lumen (lighting), MetaSounds (audio), Chaos (physics)
- **Approach**: Systems designed for emergence and flexibility

## Example Gameplay Scenario

```
Early Game (Day 1-2):
- You see a clear waypoint marker: "Find the tower"
- Mini-map shows your location and destination
- You follow the path, reach the tower, objective complete

Mid Game (Day 3-4):
- Multiple conflicting waypoints appear for "Find the tower"
- Mini-map glitches, shows false information
- You must choose which marker to trust, or navigate by landmarks

Late Game (Day 5-6):
- No UI, no markers, no map
- You remember: "There was a tower to the east, past the red rocks"
- You navigate by memory, environmental clues, and intuition
- Finding the tower feels meaningful because YOU found it
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this playable or just an art project?**
A: Both. It's a fully playable game that also explores philosophical themes through its mechanics.

**Q: Does the collapse mean the game becomes frustrating?**
A: No. Degradation is designed to be challenging but not frustrating. Players develop new skills to adapt.

**Q: Can I "win" the game?**
A: There's no traditional win/lose. The game invites you to complete the six-day cycle and reflect on the experience. You can replay with different approaches.

**Q: Is this like Dark Souls / Outer Wilds / [other game]?**
A: It shares some DNA with experimental games, but the focus on philosophical themes through system degradation is unique.

**Q: Do I need to know philosophy to enjoy this?**
A: No. The game is designed to create philosophical experiences, not require philosophical knowledge. Understanding emerges through play.
