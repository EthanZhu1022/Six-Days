# Six-Days

A philosophical exploration game built in Unreal Engine 5.5

## Overview

Six-Days is an experimental game project that explores the profound philosophical themes of **the collapse of order** and **the affirmation of existence** through interactive gameplay. Players experience a journey that challenges conventional structures, embracing chaos as a pathway to authentic being.

## Philosophical Foundation

This project is grounded in existential philosophy, drawing inspiration from thinkers who questioned absolute order and championed individual existence:

- **Collapse of Order**: The game explores how rigid systems and structures inevitably break down, revealing the arbitrary nature of imposed order
- **Affirmation of Existence**: Through gameplay, players discover meaning not in external validation, but in the raw, immediate experience of being
