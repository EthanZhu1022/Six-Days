This project aims to explore the philosophical theme of the collapse of order and the 
affirmation of existence through gameplay.  While traditional platformers emphasize 
mastery and progression, this work deliberately inverts that logic:  players gradually lose 
their rational anchors (UI, stable gravity, reliable light), and are forced to rely on instinct, 
intuition, and sensory perception to move forward in uncertainty.   
The design corresponds to Nietzsche’s proposition: when truth collapses, life can still be 
affirmed.  The game is not only a test of skill but also an existential experience:  leading 
players from the loss of safety, to the acceptance of void, and finally to acting within chaos.   
Through the rhythm of level design, the psychological curve evolves from control to 
disorientation, from anxiety to release—demonstrating how interactive media can embody 
abstract philosophy.   
Ultimately, the project seeks to prove that even after the death of order, freedom can still 
emerge.
